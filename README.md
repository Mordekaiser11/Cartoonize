# Cartoonize

In this project,we handle images and we convert them as a cartoonized thing.
We apply Gaussian blur and other blurring operations to do this.
After all implementations are done,we save that as a .png file.

With this code,you can convert whatever image you want.
My aim is to create a unique image for further purposes because i am dealing with NFT tokens.It benefits a lot for me.
